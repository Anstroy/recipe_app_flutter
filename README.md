This is my very first Flutter Project
and it is meant to help users to find food recipes
based on what they have available.

## API

This project uses [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) to retrieve information

## Authentication

The project uses [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to handle the Auth
